# CSS Hover Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue with the CSS `:hover` pseudo-class when dealing with nested elements.  The primary issue is that the hover effect is not applied to the inner element when hovering over the parent.  This often leads to unexpected behavior and a frustrating debugging experience.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` offers a corrected version.  Read the comments within the code for a detailed explanation.
