The solution involves using a more appropriate selector to ensure the hover effect works as intended:

```css
.container {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.inner {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightcoral;
}

.container:hover .inner {
  background-color: lightgreen; /* This is still not perfect and will only change the inner if it is hovered over.  See the alternative below */ 
}

/* Correct solution */
.container:hover > .inner { /* Use the direct child selector (>). This ensures that the effect applies only when hovering over the parent container.*/
  background-color: lightgreen;
}
```

By using the direct child selector (`>`), we explicitly target only the direct children of `.container`, thereby ensuring that the hover effect applies to the `.inner` element regardless of the mouse position within the parent container.
